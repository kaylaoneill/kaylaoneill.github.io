<p> My name is Kayla O'Neill and I have a background in environment and sustainability. I love nature and being outside, which is why I decided to pursue an environmental education background. </p>

<p> I have an interest in forestry, which is why I had decided to study forest management systems and policies surrounding nutrient management in forests. This allowed me to spend a great amount of time in Muskoka, supporting a research study surrounding a WoodAsh Recycling Program.
