<div.home.content-wrapper> <img src="1.png" alt="Photo of Kayla"> <h2> Background Information </h2>
<p> My name is Kayla O'Neill and I have a background in environment and sustainability. I love nature and being outside, which is why I decided to pursue an environmental education background. 
  I have an interest in forestry, which is why I had decided to study forest systems in the past. This allowed me to spend a great amount of time in nature, more particularly, forets in Muskoka, Ontario.</p>

<h2> My Past Research </h2>
  <p> While studying at Trent University, I had the privlegde to study a research project being conducted by The Friends of Muskoka Watershed. This reseach project looked at the effects of calcium deficiencies
  in the Muskoka forest. These deficiencies had been brought on by human acttions such as farming but also through acid rain. The Friends of Muskoka Watershed was convienced that using the woodash that
  Muksoka residents brunt in their home fireplaces and kitchens, we could revert some of the calcium deficiencies in the forests. </p>
